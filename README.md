# ADS_Portfolio
During my undergraduate studies I minored in sport analytics, those courses were the introduction to the word of data analytics and data science. Falling in love with it, I decided that that was going to be my career path, so when I needed to choose an internship for my capstone, I knew that I wanted it to be in sports analytics. I interned at Wasserman Management Group and while it was a great experience for me, I realized that my data analytics skills were lacking and that is when I decided that I wanted to pursue my Masters in Applied Data Science. 

Throughout my 2 years in the program, my knowledge of the field of data science has expanded so far beyond what I thought I would be doing. Not only was I able to sharpen my skills in data collection, analytics, visualization and database management, I was also able to learn new skills such as machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. 

The portfolio contains projects that cover the following objectives:
Data collection: using tools to collect and organize data 
Data analysis: identify patterns in the data via visualization, statistical analysis, and data  mining
Strategy and decisions: develop alternative strategies based on the data
Implementation: develop a plan of action to implement the business decisions
